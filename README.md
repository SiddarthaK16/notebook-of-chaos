### My DS/ML Journey 🚀

This repo is my personal playground for learning Data Science and Machine Learning.
Everything here is a mix of experiments, exercises, and “aha!” moments as I explore Python, NumPy, and other libraries on my journey.

📚 What’s Inside

NumPy drills & experiments – arrays, slicing, broadcasting, random stuff, linear algebra

Python snippets & small functions – quick utilities I keep discovering

Learning exercises – mini-challenges and practice code

Pandas drills & experiments – cleaning , transformin , preprocessing data

(Future additions: Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)

⚡ How I Use This Repo

It’s my personal scratchpad, so not all code is polished or production-ready

I try new things, break stuff, and learn along the way

If something works, I keep it here for reference

🛠️ Tech / Libraries

Python 3.x

NumPy

(Soon: Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, maybe TensorFlow)
