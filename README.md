### My DS/ML Journey 🚀

This repo is my personal playground for learning Data Science and Machine Learning.
Everything here is a mix of experiments, exercises, and “aha!” moments as I explore Python, NumPy, and other libraries on my journey.

📚 What’s Inside

NumPy drills & experiments – arrays, slicing, broadcasting, random stuff, linear algebra

Python snippets & small functions – quick utilities I keep discovering

Learning exercises – mini-challenges and practice code

Pandas drills & experiments – cleaning , transforming , preprocessing data and goofing around with data

Matplotlib and seaborn - tables are boring, making em interesting

Webscraping - using requests module and BeautifulSoup

Model training and testing - using scikit-learn



⚡ How I Use This Repo

It’s my personal scratchpad, so not all code is polished or production-ready

I try new things, break stuff, and learn along the way

If something works, I keep it here for reference
